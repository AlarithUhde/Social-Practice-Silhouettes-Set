# Social Practice Silhouettes Set

The Social Practice Silhouettes Set (SPSS) is a collection of silhouette images
of people doing things. At some point more silhouettes of more people or
"intelligent" active things such as robots may be added. The SPSS was created
as a set of stimuli for research on technology-mediated activities in social
settings, but it can be used for other purposes as well.

## How to Use

You are free to use the SPSS for almost any purpose. For example:
- as stimuli for running experiments
- in your architectural drawings to make them more "lively"
- as visual elements in your slides for a presentation
- and many more...

The images are assembled from several online sources, and each source image has
been checked to have a license that permits inclusion. The exact source url and
original license for each specific image can be found in the index.csv file.
Thus, you can use all of these images for all purposes allowed according to
their original licenses. Typically this means that you are allowed to do
everything with them, except for creating a competitive service to the original
hosters and maybe selling them without further modification.

Some of the source images have been converted into silhouettes for inclusion in
this set. In that case the silhouette has the license of the SPSS (i.e.,
[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/](CC BY 4.0)). If you use these
images or the SPSS as a whole, please cite them as follows:

## How to Contribute

You can contribute in several ways. Most importantly, if you use the SPSS in
your research and collect metadata in the process, please share them back! For
example, you may collect data about how people perceive each silhouette (e.g.,
the depicted person's gender, age, activity). These data could be interesting
for other people as well.

Other ways to contribute:
- share a link to your published research using the SPSS
- provide more silhouette images (**important**: Always include license
  information and a source url for all third party material you found on the
  internet. New images will only be included if they have a permissive license.
  If you are the original creator, an easy way to share the image would be to
  upload it to a free online service (e.g., Pixabay or Unsplash) and then share
  the url)
