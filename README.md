The Social Practice Cards (SPC) are a collection of silhouette images of people
doing things. It currently contains 204 silhouettes sorted by broad demographic
categories and postures. Over time, I hope to add more silhouettes of more
people or "intelligent" active things such as robots. The SPC was created as
a set of stimuli for research on technology-mediated activities in social
settings, but you can use it for other purposes as well.

## How to Use and Notes on Licenses

You are free to use the SPC as a whole for almost any purpose. For example:
- as stimuli for running experiments
- in your architectural drawings to make them more "lively"
- as visual elements in your slides for a presentation
- to create card games (see the templates in the "cards" subfolders for standard
  formats)
- and many more...

### Using Individual Images

If you want to use an individual image from the SPC, please refer to its
original license which can be found in the [index.csv](index.csv) file. The
images are assembled from several online sources, and each source image has been
checked to have a license that permits inclusion in the SPC. Generally speaking,
you can do everything with these images without attribution, except for creating
a competitive service to the original hosters and maybe selling them without
further modification. With some of the images you can even do that, but you
would have to check the license yourself for your case.

Some of the source images have been converted into silhouettes for inclusion in
this set, or they have been otherwise modified (e.g., split into several images
if several unrelated activities were depicted in the original). In that case,
the modified images have the license of the SPC (i.e., [CC0
1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)).

## How to Contribute

You can contribute in several ways. Most importantly, if you use the SPC in your
research and collect metadata in the process, please share them back! For
example, you may have collected data about how people perceive each silhouette
(e.g., the depicted person's gender, age, activity, ...). These data could be
interesting for other people as well. I would like to include some general
information with the SPC in the future and link to further resources from here.

Other ways to contribute:
- share a link to your published research in which you used the SPC
- provide more silhouette images (**important**: Always include license
  information and a source url for all third party material you found on the
  internet. New images can only be included if they have a permissive license,
  such as a Creative Commons Zero license. If you are the original creator,
  another easy way to share the image would be to upload it to a free online
  service (e.g., Pixabay or Unsplash) and then share the url)
- add the names or handles of the original creators of images in the
  [index.csv](index.csv) file
